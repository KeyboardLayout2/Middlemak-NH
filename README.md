# Middlemak-NH
Middlemak-NH keyboard layout
Variant of Middlemak named Middlemak-NH:

    QWLDG JFOU:
    NSRTP YHEIA
    ZXCVB KM,./
    

This is an extraordinary option.

1) First this reduces SFB even more by getting rid of NK, KN, NY, NF, NM. None of those are humongous, but they (even added with AZ) do add up. 

2) It gets all the vowels on one hand.

3) It massively reduces the back and forth bouncing. 1) On the left hand, it takes out the back and forth with A and the consonants on that hand. 2) On the right hand, it takes out the back and forth with N and the vowels on that hand.

4) I expect this would reduce pinballing even more because I think N is more common in the middle of words.

Downsides: 

The hands are a little more unbalanced. Unfortunately there is no changing that without swapping one of the uncommon letters Q, Z, X, V. That would require a lot of changes. 

It introduces ND and NG on the same hand. But really these donâ€™t feel too bad going from pinky to index.

I think this is a great option for those that want to maximize efficiency by having most vowels and consonants on opposite hands. The improvements are pretty much in league with full change layouts, while still maintaining a good amount of Qwerty similarity for both ease of learning and keeping the shortcuts of Z, X, C, V in place.
