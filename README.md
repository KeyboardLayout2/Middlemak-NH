I think this is a great layout to maximize efficiency with most vowels and consonants on opposite hands.

Specific details:

1) The most fundamental change is that it puts all the vowels on one hand and most consonants on the other. This maximizes alternating hands (since 75% of all bigrams are between vowels and consonants) while still maintaining a good amount of Qwerty similarity to make it easy to adopt and keep shortcuts the same. 

2) Second, this is a pretty impressive reduction in SFB by getting rid of NK, KN, NY, NF, and NM (and even AZ). None of those are humongous, but they do add up. 

3) It reduces NFBs. (Explanations on points 3 and 4 get pretty big, the short of it is that it reduces NFBS, massively reduces rolls, and puts in more alternating.) Full details:

3a) Left pinky: being N reduces the ring-to-pinky NFBs even more. WN, SN, and XN are much less common than WA, SA, XA.

3b) Right pinky: being A is slightly worse because it gets rid of the H inside roll. It basically splits the previous HI inside roll to half IA and half AI.

3c) RIght index: being H reduces NFB by replacing ON with OH.

4) It massively reduces rolls, replacing them with alternating hands. Full details:

4a) Left pinky: being N reduces overall rolls with the pinky by a massive 53%. The inside rolls reduce significantly, and the outside rolls to N go to almost nil. 

4b) Right hand pinky: being A reduces overall rolls with the pinky by slight 11%. There is an increase in outside rolls with the pinky (previously having H there meant there was basically no outside rolls).

4c) Right index: being H reduces overall rolls with the index by 45%. There is also an increase in outside rolls (because H to vowels is common), but the reduction from removing N is huge.

Added up the three letters on both hands and it’s an impressive 43% reduction in overall rolls.

5) I expect this would reduce pinballing even more, because H is less common than N in the middle of words and in-between vowels.

6) Putting H, as the sole common consonant, on the same hand with the vowels works very well. H has half its bigrams with vowels and half with consonants, so putting it with the vowels means ~half the bigrams are on the opposite hand. That’s not as high as the vowels (86% of bigrams with consonants), but it’s quite high all things considered.

7) This still maintains a good amount of Qwerty similarity. Not just the ZXCV, but pretty much the whole bottom row of ZXCVB_M,.? including the punctuation. On the top row it keeps QW in the same spots. On the middle row it still “keeps” part of the SRT order. The letters TG and NYJ switch on the same finger as well. I think Qwerty similarity can’t be overlooked to make it easier to learn. 

Downsides:

1) It introduces ND and NG on the same hand. These really don’t feel too bad going from pinky to index inside roll, and this is pretty small considering the amount of rolls taken out. 

2) It’s a tad more unbalanced, with the right hand doing a bit more. I think it’s still quite balanced overall.

Conclusion:

I think this is an extraordinary layout. It has low SFB, alternates hands, in league with many full change layouts, all while keeping Qwerty similarity.
